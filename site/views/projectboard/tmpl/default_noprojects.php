            Welcome to the Progress Tool. This tool will use a survey to measure what stage of development your Community
            Energy project is at and will provide guidance on what next steps to take.
        </p>

        <p class="introductionParagraph">
            To begin, click the green button on the top right corner to create a project entry. After adding details
            about the project and selecting which type of Renewable Energy it employs click “Submit”. The tool will save your project details for
            future updates.
        </p>

        <p class="introductionParagraph">
            The survey consists of 26 questions relating to different stages of a Community Energy project. Please select
            all options that apply to your project, feel free to choose more than one option.
        </p>

        <p class="introductionParagraph">
            The score tallied from the survey responses is used to populate a spider diagram, describing the progress
            under each heading from the <a href="/test">ECCO timeline</a> (<b class="people">People</b>, <b class="technology">Technology</b> and
